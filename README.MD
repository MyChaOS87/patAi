Hi and a warm welcome to my task solution. I hope I did not do way to much and you just expect a pure Hello World with 2 endpoints.

## How to run
Run via docker compose: `docker compose up --build`

This starts the service on: `localhost:8080`

After Startup you should be able to access the swagger UI via `http://localhost:8080/api/v0/openapi/ui/index.html`


## Remarks
* API:
  * OpenAPI specification came first so is not autogenerated from endpoints
  * You have to authenticate with an `X-API-Key: ` header. 
    * Any string provided should work. 
    * In swagger UI you can use the Authorize button on the `top right`. 
    * If you fancy to use multi tenancy use the key `user2` to get a different identity.
  * I designed it so that the POST will answer you with your created job, for which you then have to poll a GET `/:id` endpoint for your jobs completion
  * Additional Metadata, Pagination, User friendly Error messages, Integration Tests and such are out of scope for now
* Simulation:
  * Always finishes Jobs after 2 min (then value is estimated to 42)
  * Quota is a sliding window of 5 tasks per 5 minutes in the simulation 
  * Tests: I see that as an experiment and thus test coverage is not a focus at all
* Size of Patents: Current assumption is that timeouts will work and the request body easily fits the RAM. 
* Persistence: there is non, out of scope for now
* Testing, Linting and generation of the mocks are not automated. I'd normally do additional tooling for that in a makefile for the developers, and finally run those in the CI.
